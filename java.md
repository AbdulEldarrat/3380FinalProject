Java Critera

* Language purpose/genisis
  * Java was created to address the issue of uniformality. The creators of java wanted to have a language tat would be as few implemnetation dependencies as possible. Meant to "write once and run anywhere". Java wasn't necessaritly meant to replace any other languag but was somewhat derived from c and c++ but more high level language then the both of them.
