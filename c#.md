C# critera

* Language purpose/genisis
  * C# was created to enable developers to build applications on the .NET framework and the syntax as well as functionality is very similar to java. This language was developed to make it easier to build apps on the .NET framework. By building these applcations on the .NET framework developers can call the code (in the framework) without writing it, and thus reducing the time it takes to build one of these apps.
* Unique features of the language
  * The .NET framework is not only expansive but is periodically updated at a faster rate than Java. This allows c# to shine through as the more up to date candidate. This also alows developers to build with the newest tools and technologies.
* Name spaces (example code)
  * How are name spaces implemented?
  * How are name spaces used?
