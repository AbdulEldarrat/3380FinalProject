C# <----> JAVA

Group Partners:

  To make it easier on the grader, we have decided to link two seperate files. One for the java criteria/code and one for the C# criteria/code. You will find the following pages below.
- Java Criteria: [java](java.md)
- C# Criteria: [c#](https://github.com/AbdulEldarrat/4330FinalProject/blob/master/c%23.md)
- Sidenote: Very Interesting article i found.
 -- [What are the major differences between Java and C#?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-major-differences-between-Java-and-C)

## OO Language Comparison

* Pick two object-oriented languages.
* Form a team to work on the comparison.
  * You can be a team of 1.
  * Teams greater than 4 are usually not a good idea.
* Using the comparison criteria provided, compare the two languages
through documentation and code examples.
* The documentation is to be written in markdown.
* The documentation and code examples are to be in a
GitHub public repository that the team uses.
* The **home page** is to be the README.md for the repository.
* Other mark down pages can be linked using relative links in markdown files.
  * [Relative links in markdown files](https://github.com/blog/1395-relative-links-in-markup-files).
  * Here is an example of a relative link to another md: [second.md](second.md)
* The README.md is to include near the top:
    * The two languages being compared.
    * The names of the members of the team.
* The URL for the GitHub repository for your team is to be submitted via an assignment on Canvas.

### Comparison Criteria

* 1)Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
  * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* 2)Unique features of the language
  * Does the language have any particularly unique features?
* 3)Name spaces
  * How are name spaces implemented?
  * How are name spaces used?
* 4)Types
    * What types does the language support?
    * Are both reference and value types supported?
    * Can new value types be created?
* 5)Classes
  * Defining
  * Creating new instances
  * Constructing/initializing
  * Destructing/de-initializing
* 6)Instance reference name in data type (class)
  * this?  self?
* 7)Properties
  * Getters and setters...write your own or built in?
  * Backing variables?
  * Computed properties?
* 8)Interfaces / protocols
  * What does the language support?
  * What abilities does it have?
  * How is it used?
* 9)Inheritance / extension
* 10)Reflection
  * What reflection abilities are supported?
  * How is reflection used?
* 11)Memory management
  * How is it handled?
  * How does it work?
  * Garbage collection?
  * Automatic reference counting?
* 12)Comparisons of references and values
  * How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)
* 13)Null/nil references
  * Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
  * Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
* 14)Errors and exception handling
* 15)Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
* 16)Implementation of listeners and event handlers
* 17)Singleton
  * How is a singleton implemented?
  * Can it be made thread-safe?
  * Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?
* 18)Procedural programming
  * Does the language support procedural programming?
* 19)Functional programming
  * Does the language support functional programming?
* 20)Multithreading
  * Threads or thread-like abilities
  * How is multitasking accomplished?
